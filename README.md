Can interact with the users initial given amount and hold the updated amount again.
##Hashing process will be changed with openssl system.
##Functions will be orianted and improved.
##To use this program you can just the .c file as it is. But you'll have to register a account to use the login function. Or it will give NULL since there is no any file for it to read. If you download the registry.text file, you can use the login function as it is since there is a 'Dummy' account already there
